# 4. Description
Anapickle performs two functions; it accepts, analyses and manipulates a supplied pickle or it can
produce Pickle shellcode as a standalone generator using a templated library. As an analyser, it includes
a simplified Pickle version 0 simulator that extracts a list of callables used by the pickle stream as well as
determines the position and type of all useful entities (strings, unicodes and ints) without subjecting the
pickle stream to a potentially dangerous loads() call (since loads() is the vulnerable method, we would
be remiss in simply piping any unknown pickle through a local loads() call). As a shellcode generator it
takes the name of a shellcode template and inserts user-supplied parameters such as filenames or shell
commands.
